# UniBak
UniBak is a user profile backup and restore tool designed for use on several flavors of Linux as well as MacOS. It has been under slow development since 2013, and first made an appearance on github in February of 2020. Originally designed for Helpdesk Staff at a university,  the end goal is to have the script generalized so that anyone can use it. Official 1.0 will take place once everything has been cleaned up and ironed out with user customizations such as server options selectable via a separate config file.

Other details and instructions will be added at a later time.
